This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
